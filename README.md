## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 

Svelte/SvelteKit, JavaScript/HTML/CSS

Please be sure to checkout [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte), and 

## `npm -install`

## Optimizations:
To improve this website, I would like to incorporate lazy-loading on the images in the gallery section. I am capable of lazy-loading img elements, however the images in the gallery section are actually placed in div elements using the CSS "background-image" property and I am not yet knowledgable on how to lazy-load these. It was easier and looked nicer for me to make a responsive grid-layout using "background-image", however if I am unable to effectively lazy-load when the images are in this manner, I might consider making a responsive grid-layout without using the "background-image" property and instead using img elements.

## Lessons Learned:
This is my first project in which I used CSS grid; all previous projects and contributions, I used display: flex. When it comes to dealing with multiple columns, grid makes a lot more sense to use than flex, and I plan to consider using grid more in my future projects.
